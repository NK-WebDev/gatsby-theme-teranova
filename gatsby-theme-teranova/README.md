    ```js
    module.exports = {
      title: "Teranova",
      description: "A single page gatsby theme created by Nirjan Khadka",
      url: "https://nifty-sinoussi-4a8cab.netlify.com",

      twitterUsername: "@nirjankhadka",
      facebookUsername: "nirjankhadka13",
      instagramUsername: "nk13.dev",
      phone: "555 219 619",
      email: "info@teranova.com",
      address: "Stewart Street, Marks Avenue, California",
      mapUrl:
        "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3306.033277112893!2d-118.26944278515673!3d34.04301748060843!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x80c2c7b85dea2a93%3A0x1ff47c3ceb7bb2d5!2sSTAPLES+Center!5e0!3m2!1sen!2snp!4v1564632144369!5m2!1sen!2snp",
      logo: "/images/logo.svg",
      trackingId: "UA-135638651-2", //google analytics
      // options for gatsby plugin manifest
      shortName: "teranova",
      pathPrefix: "/",
      backgroundColor: "#F9F9F9",
      themeColor: "#FFD700",
      favicon: "static/images/favicon.png", // path from the root
      // gatsby sitemap plugin needs this
      siteUrl: "https://nifty-sinoussi-4a8cab.netlify.com"
    };
    ```
5.  Add a src/pages/index.mdx file to your project with the following components

    ```mdx
        import Intro from 'gatsby-theme-teranova/src/components/intro';
        import About from 'gatsby-theme-teranova/src/components/about';
        import Services from 'gatsby-theme-teranova/src/components/services';
        import Contact from 'gatsby-theme-teranova/src/components/contact';

        <Intro />

        <About />

        <Services />

        <Contact />
    ```

    **Note: You can reorder the components or add new custom components to this mdx file**

6.  Add static/images/favicon.png to your project. The gatsby-plugin-manifest needs this image.

7.  Start your site

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

8.  You can override colors by creating a `src/gatsby-theme-teranova/theme.js` file with object:
    ```js
    export const theme = {
      fonts: {
        families: ["Roboto", "Vollkorn"],
        body: '"Roboto",sans-serif',
        heading: '"Vollkorn",serif'
      },
      fontSizes: [0.75, 1, 1.33, 1.77, 2.369, 3.157],
      fontWeights: {
        body: 400,
        heading: "700",
        bold: 700
      },
      spacing: [0.618, 1, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236, 6.854, 11.089],
      lineHeights: {
        body: 1.7,
        heading: 1.2
      },
      letterSpacings: {
        body: "normal",
        caps: "0.2rem"
      },
      colors: {
        primary: "#FFD700",
        dark: "#333",
        grey: "#B2AB99",
        secondaryLight: "#00FFD8",

      }
    };
    ```
